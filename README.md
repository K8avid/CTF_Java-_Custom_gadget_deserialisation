# Root-me CTF challenge writeup : Java - Custom gadget deserialization

## 1. What is Serialization and Deserialization  

### Serialization
is the process of converting a Java object into a stream of bytes so that it can be stored (e.g., in a file or database) or transmitted (e.g., over a network). This allows complex data structures, like classes or objects, to be saved and later reconstructed.

### Deserialization
It is the reverse process: it takes a stream of bytes and reconstructs the original Java object in memory.  
  
------
  
In a secure context, serialization is useful for persisting application state or sending objects between systems. However, when deserialization is done on untrusted data, it can become a serious security risk. If an attacker manages to send crafted serialized data, and if the application blindly deserializes it without validation, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.


## 2. Gathering information and understanding the code

Starting the challenge, we are welcomed by the following login page

We can use Burp Suite to see if there is anything interesting in the HTTP request we send by entering the page or attempting to log in, and we did find an interesting CSRF token:

And it does look like it is being encoded in base64, we can try to decode it and we get the following result:

It seems like we are chaining methods from an initial class called `UUID`, there does not seem to be more â€” let's dive into the provided source code!

Directed by our find, let's check the methods that are handling the `/login` route.  
First of all, we can see that in the `HomeIndex` class, located in `src/main/java/com/rootme/serial`,  

![Login_page](https://github.com/K8avid/CTF_Java-_Custom_gadget_deserialisation/blob/main/get_login.png)  

GET to the `/login` route creates a CSRF token and adds it to the model:

![Login_page](https://github.com/K8avid/CTF_Java-_Custom_gadget_deserialisation/blob/main/post_login.png)  

The POST method to the `/login` route takes a CSRF token as a parameter and then deserializes it by calling `deserialize()` from the `SerializationUtils` class.  
After decoding it from base64, the `deserialize()` method itself calls `readObject()`, which will read and recreate the object:

The base64 decoder has nothing in particular, but if we take a closer look at `readObject()`, it calls a `run()` method that requires a boolean `debug` field of the class `DebugHelper` it is in, to be `true`.  
The `readObject()` method belongs to a `DebugHelper` class in the same folder, which means that the CSRF token we will pass should be an object of that class.

Here at the beginning of the `run` method:  

![Login_page](https://github.com/K8avid/CTF_Java-_Custom_gadget_deserialisation/blob/main/run.png)  

If we can set the `debug` field to `true`, by reading the function we can see that it will start by decoding a base64 encoded command, then execute it and store the result in the `output` field.  
The following `toString()` method has been overridden and prints the output when calling the `print` method on a `DebugHelper` object:

![Login_page](https://github.com/K8avid/CTF_Java-_Custom_gadget_deserialisation/blob/main/toString.png)  

At this point we can sense that, if we provide an ingeniously crafted CSRF token, we will most likely be able to execute remote code, so let's try to serialize ourselves a `DebugHelper` type object with the right fields!

## 3. Creating the right payload  

To craft the CSRF payload, we can create our own class in the folder we downloaded, use the different functions available and finally print the result. Here is an example:

![Login_page](https://github.com/K8avid/CTF_Java-_Custom_gadget_deserialisation/blob/main/payload_gen.png)  

After copy-pasting the payload to the CSRF field of the HTTP request in Burp Suite, you will get a response containing the desired flag:
